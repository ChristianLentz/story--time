chapter 1 

It was a tuesday in comp 225. 


lauren brought her dog to class
it was awesome 
maybe even cool perhaps 

We were sked by Lauren to write a story in markdown files. 

The goal of the activity was to learn about merge conficts. 
instead of thinking about merge conflicts we thought about
seeing dogs when walking around campus 
but with it getting colder 
less dogs will be there
If I had to guess, there will probably be a merge conflit. 

Uh oh.
